    <p style="margin-top: 50px">
        Graphic design and psychology have always been interesting to me.
        Combining the two has lead me to the wonderful world of UX/UI.
        I hope to use the skills I have learned to guide me onto a successful career path.

    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> There are currently very few apps that allow users to search
        for happy hours at nearby restaurants.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Create an app to help users find happy hour deals
        nearby by adding filters such as times, cuisine, prices, etc. to
        their search criteria.</p>
    <p><strong>MappyHour</strong> was designed to make the process of finding happy hour
        specials effortless for our users striving to save money.
        We have observed that existing apps are not meeting the users’
        need to browse food and drink deals, which is causing our users
        to not go out as frequently or to spend over their budget when they
        do go out. </p>
